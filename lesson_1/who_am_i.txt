hi! i've tried taking some python tutorials before, but i think i was missing the fundamentals of like... what is a command line ... and how do I make sure I don't mess up my entire computer? before even jumping into object based languages or whatever the term is. i'm really hopeful that skilling up in database / engineering best practices will help me become a more efficient data analyst and research team member!
